    // start with strings, numbers and booleans

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.

    // You might think we can just do something like this:

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    console.log('this is players ',`${players}`)

    // one way
    const players2 = players.slice();
    players2[2] = 'Laura';
    console.log('this is players2 ',`${players2}`)

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    players3 = [].concat(players);
    players3[2] = 'Lucas';
    console.log('this is players3 ',`${players3}`)

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const players4 = [...players]
    players4[2] = 'DING DONG';
    console.log('this is players4 ',`${players4}`)

    const players5 = Array.from(players);
    players5[2] = 'DONG DING'
    console.log('this is players5 ',`${players5}`)


    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
    console.log('this is players ',`${players}`)

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Laura',
      surname: 'Zerbini',
      age: 29
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    // const brother = person;
    // brother.age = 30

    // console.log(person.age)

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const brother = Object.assign({}, person, {name:'Lucas', age:30, city:'Campinas'});
    console.log(brother)

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const person2 = {...person};
    console.log(person2)

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects.
    // lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
